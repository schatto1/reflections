When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

You would want to use your remote repository when you are working on a 
collaborative project with multiple people, from a different machine as
your usual workstation, or if your workstation does not have the storage
capacity to have the complete project saved on it's hard disk. When
working on a collaborative project, using a remote repository allows you
and your collaborators to have one central repository to refer to, and 
decreases the number of times branches are created or merged. If working
from a machine that is different from your usual workstation, if your
project is on a remote repository, you can instantly sync the progress
onto your current workstation, make the changes, and then push it back
to the remote repository, so you can update the local copy on your main
workstation later. You can also push projects to your remote repository,
and if possible and prudent, get rid of the local copy, freeing up some
space on your local drive.
